beforehand. If you are busy at work, our recommendation is that you ask to do this test on a
weekend. We are very flexible as long as you provide a reasonable explanation.
  
  Not having enough time will not be accepted as an excuse to deliver an unsatisfactory solution.
  
  
## Background
  
  
Lannister Carriage Services provides commute and transportation services to a number of
towns in the great land of Westeros. Because of economical reasons and to avoid ambushes,
most routes are "oneway".
That is, a route from Volantis to King's Landing does not imply in a
route from King's Landing to Volantis. In fact, even if both of these routes do happen to exist,
they are distinct and are not necessarily the same distance!


## Story Phase


As a Lannister Carriage Services customer I want to know the available routes between towns
as well as their distances so I can choose the best route for my travel.


## Business Narrative/Scenario

The purpose of this application is to help Lannister Carriage Services provide its customers
information about the routes. In particular, you will compute the distance along a certain route,
the number of different routes between two towns, and the shortest route between two towns.


## Functional / Acceptance Criteria

The input will be given as a directed graph where a node represents a town and an edge represents a route between two towns. The weighting of the edge represents the distance between the two towns. A given route will never appear more than once, and for a given route, the starting and ending town will not be the same town.

The directed graph will be represented as plain text, where the towns are named using letters from the alphabet. A route from town A to town B with distance 5 is represented by the string **AB5**. It also can be represented as JSON:

```javascript
{ 
  "source": "A",
  "target": "B",
  "distance":5
}
```

### Save graph configuration

This endpoint should receive a graph and store it in the database for future references. It should associate an integer identifier to the graph and send it on the response body.

* Endpoint: `http://<host>:<port>/graph`
* HTTP Method: POST
* HTTP Response Code: CREATED
* Contract:
  * Request payload

```javascript
{
  "data":[
    {

    },
    { 
      "source": "E", "target": "D", "distance":7
    }
  ]
}
```

### Retrieve graph configuration

This endpoint should retrieve a previously saved graph from the database. If the graph doesn't exist, should return a NOT FOUND error response.

* Endpoint: `http://<host>:<port>/graph/<graph id>`
* HTTP Method: GET
* HTTP Response Code: OK

    },
    { 
      "source": "A", "target": "E", "distance":4
    },
    { 
      "source": "B", "target": "A", "distance":6
    },
    { 
      "source": "B", "target": "C", "distance":2
    },
    { 
      "source": "B", "target": "D", "distance":4
    },
    { 
      "source": "C", "target": "B", "distance":3
    },

    },
    { 
      "source": "C", "target": "E", "distance":7
    },
    { 
      "source": "D", "target": "B", "distance":8
    },
    {

    },
    { 
      "source": "E", "target": "D", "distance":7
    }
  ]
}
```

### Find available routes from a given pair of towns on saved graph

This endpoint should compute all available routes from any given pair of towns within a given maximum number
of stops in a previously saved graph. If there's no available routes, the result should be an empty list. In case the parameter "maxStops" is not provided, you should list all routes for the given pair of towns. If the graph doesn't exist in the database, it should return a NOT FOUND error response.

For instance, in the graph (AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7), the possible routes from A to C with maximum of 3 stops would be: ["ABC", "ADC", "AEBC"]

* Endpoint: `http://<host>:<port>/routes/<graph id>/from/<town 1>/to/<town 2>?maxStops=<maximum number of stops>`
* HTTP Method: POST
* HTTP Response Code: OK
* Contract:
  * Request payload: none
  * Response payload

```javascript
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "route": "ABC",
      "stops": 2
    },
    {
      "route": "ADC",
      "stops": 2
    },
    {
      "route": "AEBC",
      "stops": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

### Find distance for path on saved graph

This endpoint should receive a ordered list of towns and retrieve the total distance on walking through the list of towns in the order they appear on the request in a previously saved graph. If the list of towns is empty or has a single element, the result should be zero. If there's no path described by the list of towns, the result should be -1. If the graph doesn't exist in the database, it should return a NOT FOUND error response.

* Endpoint: `http://<host>:<port>/distance/<graph id>`
* HTTP Method: POST
* HTTP Response Code: OK
* Contract:
  * Request payload

```javascript
{
  "path":["A", "B", "C", "D"]
}
```

  * Response payload

```javascript
{
  "distance" : 9
}
```

### Find distance between two towns on saved graph

This endpoint should find the shortest path between two towns in a previously saved graph. If the start and end town are the same, the result should be zero. If there's no path between these towns, it should be -1. If the graph doesn't exist in the database, it should return a NOT FOUND error response.

* Endpoint: `http://<host>:<port>/distance/<graph id>/from/<town 1>/to/<town 2>`
* HTTP Method: POST
* HTTP Response Code: OK
* Contract:
  * Request payload: none

  * Response payload

```javascript
{
  "distance" : 8,
  "path" : ["A", "B", "C"]
}
```

## Technical Details

*Please pay attention on the the advices listed below.*

To start the development, please create a fork of this repository to your user account. That version will be used during the evaluation.

You should implement more than a barebone algorithm. We are expecting a runnable application with a minimal structure. You should create an object model and use design patterns wherever they are appropriate, but try to keep things simple.

1. The application already have a Maven build set up.
2. Make sure your test suite is part of the build once you create it.
3. The application starts with a Maven command: mvn spring-boot:run
4. You can set up another way to start your application without Spring Boot but please make sure you **DO NOT BREAK** the Spring Boot initialization. Your application should work correctly when using Spring Boot initialize command.
5. The application must have a stateless API and use a database to store data. 
6. An embedded H2 in-memory database is already available for usage from the configuration of the project. Feel free to change that implementation but you must guarantee your application will initialize as a standalone process on any different environment.
7. Although you can change the port the application will use on your local development, please make sure you **DO NOT CHANGE IT** on your repository.
8. Make sure default Maven package strategy is JAR
9. **DO NOT** change the generated artifact name/pattern
10. The database and tables creation should be done by Maven (extending the build process) or by the application. 
11. Please document any additional information you think it's required to evaluate properly your test.

## Evaluation

Once you finish your assessment please create a merge request to push your changes to Avenue Code's repository. The evaluation will take the version you had at that moment and no future changes will be accepted.

We recommend that you use your forked version of this repository to organize your development process. Push small changes to the repository and implement the features using baby steps may be a good tip to avoid spending too much time on debugging errors. You can use many commits and branches you like but make sure you have the merge request created **ONLY AT THE END OF YOUR DEVELOPMENT**.

## Assessment Guidelines

You will be assessed on the following aspects, sorted by priority:
1. Code cleanness and naming consistency
2. Object orientation design
3. Automated tests (unit and/or integration tests)
4. Appropriate use of the language, framework features and best practices
5. Correct execution
6. Feature completeness

Please keep in mind that, for this assessment, it is more important that you deliver quality code than a feature complete implementation. Your code will still be evaluated even if you couldn't implement all the acceptance criteria.
You're expected to complete this assessment without anyone's help. We will ask questions about your code in an interview. **Play fairly!**
